# 🏡 HBnB – System Design (Part 1)

This repository contains **Part 1 of the HBnB project**, developed as part of the **Holberton School Full Stack Software Engineering program**.

This stage focuses on **system design and architecture**, before implementing the backend.

The goal is to design a platform similar to **Airbnb**, allowing users to:

* create an account
* list places
* browse available places
* leave reviews
* manage amenities

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

The purpose of this phase is to understand how to **design a complex backend system before coding it**.

Key objectives include:

* analyzing application requirements
* designing a scalable architecture
* modeling entities and relationships
* creating UML diagrams
* documenting system interactions

---

# 🏗 System Architecture

The application is built around four main entities.

### 👤 User

Represents a platform user.

Responsibilities:

* account creation
* authentication
* profile management

---

### 🏠 Place

Represents a property available for booking.

Each place contains:

* owner
* description
* location
* price
* amenities

---

### ⭐ Review

Allows users to leave feedback on a place.

A review contains:

* rating
* comment
* author
* associated place

---

### 🛠 Amenity

Represents features available in a place.

Examples include:

* Wi-Fi
* swimming pool
* parking
* air conditioning
